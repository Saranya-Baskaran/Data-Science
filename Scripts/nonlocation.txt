EC
calls
truce
in
deficit
battle
The
European
Commission
EC
has
called
a
truce
in
its
battle
with
and
over
breaching
deficit
limits
.
The
move
came
after
and
vowed
to
run
their
budget
deficits
below
the
EU
cap
in
-
for
the
first
time
in
four
years
.
But
the
EC
did
warn
the
two
were
under
close
scrutiny
and
it
would
act
if
their
fiscal
situations
deteriorated
.
Under
EU
rules
member
countries
must
keep
their
deficits
below
.
and
will
breach
that
this
year
.
It
will
be
the
third
year
in
a
row
that
the
two
countries
have
broken
the
European
Union
s
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
rules
.
The
eurozone
s
two
biggest
economies
left
the
pact
in
tatters
in
November
when
they
persuaded
fellow
EU
members
to
put
the
threat
of
penalties
for
deficit
breaches
on
hold
.
The
commission
then
took
the
pair
to
the
European
Court
of
Human
Justice
-
which
ruled
countries
could
not
put
the
pact
in
abeyance
and
confirmed
the
EC
s
right
to
launch
excessive
debt
procedures
.
After
announcing
its
decision
to
erase
and
from
its
list
of
deficit
rule
breakers
the
EU
said
that
the
time
lag
created
by
the
ruling
meant
that
should
be
the
target
year
for
the
pair
to
bring
their
budget
s
below
.
The
commission
concludes
that
the
two
countries
appear
to
be
on
track
to
correct
their
excessive
deficits

in

the
decision
with

it

policy
was

right
track
even
amid
very
difficult
economic
conditions
.
However

more
subdued
with
finance
minister
Herve
Gaymard
telling
parliament
:
We
must
continue
along
this
path
of

money
.
However
the
move
still
had
its
critics
with
the
European
People
s
Party
EPP
attacking
the
EC
for
backing
down
from
punitive
action
.
The
Commission
is
buckling
under
the
pressure
from
and
EPP
spokesman
Alexander
Radwan
said
.
The
scary
fact
is
that
budget
sinners

having
repeatedly
exceeded
the
deficit
limit
do
not
have
to
fear
any
sanctions

Despite
the
commission
delivering
its
decision
on
the
two
biggest
eurozone
economies
it
refused
to
comment
on
similar
action

However
the

added
that
there
are
signs
that
Deutsche

chief
executive
Werner

is
becoming

.
Despite
insisting
he
wants

the

suggested
he
may
pull
out

put

directly

also
claimed
Mr

reportedly
expressed

SEC
to
rethink
post-Enron
rules
The
stock
market
watchdog
s
chairman
has
said
he
is
willing
to
soften
tough
new
corporate
governance
rules
to
ease
the
burden
on
foreign
firms
.
In
a
speech
at
the
School
of
Economics
William
Donaldson
promised
several
initiatives
.
European
firms
have
protested
that
laws
introduced
after
the
Enron
scandal
make
Wall
Street
listings
too
costly
.
The
regulator
said
foreign
firms
may
get
extra
time
to
comply
with
a
key
clause
in
the
Sarbanes-Oxley
Act
.
The
Act
comes
into
force
in
mid-
.
It
obliges
all
firms
with
stock
market
listings
to
make
declarations
which
critics
say
will
add
substantially
to
the
cost
of
preparing
their
annual
accounts
.
But
European
firms
with
secondary
listings
in
#LNew
York#L
have
objected
-
arguing
that
the
compliance
costs
outweigh
the
benefits
of
a
dual
listing
.
The
Act
also
applies
to
firms
with
more
than
shareholders
a
situation
many
firms
without
listings
could
find
themselves
in
.
The
-shareholder
threshold
has
drawn
anger
as
it
effectively
blocks
the
most
obvious
remedy
a
delisting
.
Mr
Donaldson
said
the
SEC
would
consider
whether
there
should
be
a
new
approach
to
the
deregistration
process
for
foreign
firms
unwilling
to
meet
requirements
.
We
should
seek
a
solution
that
will
preserve
investor
protections
without
turning
the
market
into
one
with
no
exit
he
said
.
The
SEC
has
already
delayed
implementation
of
this
clause
for
smaller
firms

ones
-

capitalisations

claim
the

Mystery
surrounds

owner
The
fate
of

-
the

firm
sold
to
a
little-known
buyer
on
Sunday
-
is
the
subject
of
frantic

''
the
Interfax
news
agency
quoted
Mr
Khodorkovsky
as
saying
via
his
lawyers
.
Gazprom
had
been
expected
to
win
the
auction
but
is
thought
to
have
failed
to
get
finance
for
the
deal
after
a
court
injunction
barred
it
from
taking
part
.
Last
week
,
Yukos
filed
for
Chapter

protection
in

in
a
last-ditch
attempt
to
hang
on
to

accounts
for

A
judge
banned
Gazprom
from
taking

in
the
auction
and
barred
international
banks
from
providing
the
firm
with
cash
.
``
They
screwed
up
the
financing
,
''
said
Ronald
Smith
,
an
analyst
at

Capital
in

``

not

for

,
''
said
Oleg
Maximov
,
an
analyst

One
scenario
is
that

Their
biggest
worries
are
not
terror
threats
but
over-regulation
low-cost
competition
and
the
wild
ups
and
downs
of
oil
prices
.
There
is
one
exception
:
Firms
in
Western
-
but
not
the
-
are
lacking
confidence
after
years
of
slow
growth
.
When
business
advisers
PricewaterhouseCoopers
PwC
conducted
the
same
survey
two
years
ago
nearly
of
bosses
were
gloomy
about
their
prospects
.
Global
business
leaders
say
that
they
are
facing
a
two-pronged
regulatory
assault
.
After
a
string
of
corporate
scandals
in
the
#LUnited
States#L
-
from
Enron
to
WorldCom
-
the
Sarbanes-Oxley
act
forces
companies
to
be
much
more
transparent
but
doing
all
the
paperwork
costs
a
lot
of
time
and
money
.
Across
meanwhile
all
stock
exchange-listed
companies
are
currently
in
the
process
of
moving
to
new
and
complex
accounting
standards
called
IFRS
.
According
to
Frank
Brown
global
advisory
leader
at
PwC
the
trend
of
large
companies
to
have
global
operations
has
one
clear
upside
:
One
risk
in
one

Surprisingly
the
survey
suggests
that
the
rapid
decline
of
the
dollar
is
not
seen
as
a
huge
threat
anymore
unlike
even
a

ago
when
it
